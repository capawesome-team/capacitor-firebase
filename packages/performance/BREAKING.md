# Breaking Changes

This is a comprehensive list of the breaking changes introduced in the major version releases of Capacitor Firebase Performance plugin.

## Versions

- [Version 6.x.x](#version-6xx)
- [Version 5.x.x](#version-5xx)
- [Version 1.x.x](#version-1xx)

## Version 6.x.x

### Variables

- On Android, the `firebasePerfVersion` variable has been updated to `20.5.2`.

## Version 5.x.x

This plugin now supports Capacitor 5 only. Please run `npx cap sync` after updating this package.

If you want to use this plugin with Capacitor 4, please install version `1.4.0`:

```
npm i @capacitor-firebase/performance@1.4.0
```

### Performance Monitoring Gradle plugin

Update the Performance Monitoring Gradle plugin in your root-level (project-level) Gradle file (usually `android/build.gradle`) to version `1.4.2`:

```diff
- classpath 'com.google.firebase:perf-plugin::1.4.1'
+ classpath 'com.google.firebase:perf-plugin::1.4.2'
```

### Localized error messages

On Android, error messages were previously generated with `getLocalizedMessage`. They are no longer localized and are generated with `getMessage` instead.

You should therefore check your error handling.
