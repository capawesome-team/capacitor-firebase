This is a comprehensive list of the breaking changes introduced in the major version releases of Capacitor Firebase App Check plugin.

## Version 5.x.x

### Capacitor 5

This plugin now supports Capacitor 5 only. Please run `npx cap sync` after updating this package.

If you want to use this plugin with Capacitor 4, please install version `1.4.0`:

On Android, error messages were previously generated with `getLocalizedMessage`. They are no longer localized and are generated with `getMessage` instead.

You should therefore check your error handling.
