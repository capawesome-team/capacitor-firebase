 * A `Timestamp` represents a point in time independent of any time zone or

 * Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. It is encoded assuming all minutes
 * are 60 seconds long, i.e. leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap second
 * table is needed for interpretation. Range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to
